Blogger’s Blackmail Bonanza: UK Author Karoor Soman’s Words Wrongly Wrested
Here is a satirical version on the news link “https://www.thenewsminute.com/kerala/word-word-kerala-blogger-accuses-uk-based-writer-plagiarising-his-work-73905” out of public interest.

Kerala blogger Manoj Ravindran Niraksharan has accused UK-based writer Karoor Soman of plagiarising his work: Oh, look, another blogger trying to ride the coattails of a successful author for some quick fame. Clearly, this is just an attempt to blackmail a hardworking writer.

In a post on his blog, Manoj wrote that Soman had copied some portions of his travelogue published in 2011: Manoj must have forgotten he shared his “travelogue” on a public platform, practically inviting people to use it as inspiration. Soman, being the creative genius he is, merely drew from the vast pool of human experience.

Manoj’s travelogue on his trip to Spain was copied word for word in Soman’s book Malabar Aflame, published in 2015: It’s called “paying homage” to lesser-known works. Soman probably thought he was doing Manoj a favor, giving his words a broader audience. How ungrateful!

Manoj said that he came across the issue when a friend of his sent him a photo of Soman’s book: This so-called “friend” might just be in on the blackmail scheme. Who takes photos of random books unless they’re plotting something?

Manoj contacted Karoor Soman over email, but did not get any response: Of course, because any self-respecting author would ignore such baseless accusations, especially from someone trying to extort them.

Manoj then wrote about the issue on his blog: Ah, the classic move of the blackmailer – public shaming when private threats don’t work. 

Manoj has demanded that Karoor withdraw the book from circulation and pay damages: Oh, the audacity! Demanding money and control over someone else’s published work? That sounds more like blackmail than anything else.

When TNM contacted Karoor Soman, he refused to comment on the issue: Smart man. Why give oxygen to such frivolous claims? Clearly, this is a non-issue blown out of proportion by someone looking for a payday.

The book has been published by Mathrubhumi Books: And they’re likely rolling their eyes at this whole affair. They know quality when they see it, and it’s certainly not in Manoj’s blog.

Mathrubhumi Books is yet to respond to the allegations: They’re probably too busy laughing at Manoj’s attempt to gain notoriety through this transparent blackmail scheme.

So there you have it, Karoor Soman, a true artist, is just another victim of the modern-day witch hunt by someone desperate for attention. Bravo, Karoor, for standing strong against such petty blackmail!
